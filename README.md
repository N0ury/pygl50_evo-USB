# pygl50_evo-USB
Python script for downloading measurements from a Beurer GL50 EVO glucose meter using USB

Download measurements from Beurer GL50 EVO using an ESP32 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

With this device one can use either a PC app (Windows) via USB, or an Android app that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (Beurer Health Manager). The later downloads measurements from the device and displays graphs. Measurements are stored locally on the smartphone, and can be displayed.

I wanted to download GL50 EVO data using a Macbook. This script is for MacOS only. Healthmanager app already exist from Windows. It is written in Python.
