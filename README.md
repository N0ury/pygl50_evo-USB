# pygl50_evo-USB
Python script for downloading measurements from a Beurer GL50 EVO glucose meter using USB

Download measurements from Beurer GL50 EVO using an ESP32 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

With this device one can use either a PC app (Windows) via USB, or an Android app that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (Beurer Health Manager).

I wanted to download GL50 EVO data using a Macbook. This script is written in Python, and isfor MacOS and Linux only. Healthmanager app already exist from Windows.
